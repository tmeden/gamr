# Gamr

Gamr is the beginning of a social networking app. It has users, groups, posts, comments, and likes. As it grows it will take on admin functionality, friendships, events, notifications and more.

It's a project to show a full stack application using Django REST Framework and AngularJS. The API was built to accomidate the needs of mobile developers. The web interface ended up following the mobile design for simplicity.

The most difficult part of the project was working with authentication. My favorite part of the project was working with serializers and the many little things that come with working on a web interface.
